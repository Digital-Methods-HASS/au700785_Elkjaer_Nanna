This repository contains my collection of weekly assignments completed during the six week course "Teoriorienteret metode: Digital Methods" with Adela Sobotkova.
Furthermore, it contains my finale project for the end of semester exam. My finale project is on preservation of buildings in Denmark. 
I have created a digital map of the preserved buildings in Denmark.
